1. DESCRIPTION
This program allows the user to explore a 3D backyard, including
a field of grass, a fence, and the moon in the night sky. The user
can walk around in this backyard and look around at any angle desired.

Each of the objects has a texture and lighting applied to it (including
each individual blade of grass!).
