1. DESCRIPTION
This program allows the user to explore a 3D backyard, including
a field of grass, a fence, and the moon in the night sky. The user
can walk around in this backyard and look around at any angle desired.

This program features two viewing modes: orthogonal and perspective.
In perspective mode, the user has a 'first person' view of the world,
and can walk around and look wherever he/she desires. In orthogonal
mode, the user looks at the world from a bird's eye view, and is 
able to change the viewing angle only.
